# urenPy
Flask app to keep track of working hours

# To do
* add the uren-tab
* Create a `requirements` file for the virtualenv
* Use a WSGI Production server for flask

# How to use
Just run `python app.py` and the deploy-script will create an empty database-file named `urenPy.db`.

After that, the flask-app runs on http://0.0.0.0:8050/dash.
